This is Worqu, a simple web-based program to manage a queue of tasks.
It's just in alpha state, and needs improvements, but it's already good enough
for dispatching work to co-workers and as a reminder for yourself.

Workqu is meant to be a tool for quickly dispatching tasks that are in your
bugtracker(s) so that everyone knows which task is the next importent one and
does finish unimportant tasks while there are important ones open.

BTW: There is no authentication at all, everyone can mess up the queue. :)

How to get this to work:
- create a postgres database
- create new users manually with psql (see scheme.sql)
- edit inc.py, put in username, password etc.
- make sure your webserver supports python
- apache example:

	<Directory "/var/www/foo">
		Options +ExecCGI
		AddHandler cgi-script .py
	</Directory>
- have a look at index.py ;)
