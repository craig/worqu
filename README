This is worqu, a simple web-based program to manage a queue of tasks.
It's just in alpha state, and needs improvements, but it's already good enough
for dispatching work to co-workers and as a reminder for yourself.

workqu is meant to be a tool for quickly dispatching tasks that are in your
bugtracker(s) so that everyone knows which task is the next importent one and
does not begin unimportant tasks while there are important ones open.

BTW: There is no authentication at all, everyone can mess up the queue. :)

How to get this to work:
- create user for postgres database (CREATE ROLE worqu WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'worqu';)
- create a postgres database (CREATE DATABASE worqu;)
- create new users manually with psql (see scheme.sql)
- edit inc.py, put in username, password etc.
- install the python module psycopg2 (called python-psycopg2 in debian)
- make sure your webserver supports python
- apache example:

	<Directory "/var/www/foo">
		DirectoryIndex index.py
		Options +ExecCGI
		AddHandler cgi-script .py
	</Directory>

Optional:
- mkdir /var/www/foo/img, put your favorite wallpapers there
- add URLs to the top of worqu: INSERT INTO toplink (url, descr) VALUES ('http://foo','foo');
